# WDF Implementation of a piezoelectric MEMS loudspeaker
In this assignment, we developed a Wave Digital Filter (WDF) model of a piezoelectric MEMS loudspeaker, based on its linear lumped-element model (LEM) representation.
Starting from the equivalent mechanical domain circuit, the corresponding WDF was derived according to the following schematic:
